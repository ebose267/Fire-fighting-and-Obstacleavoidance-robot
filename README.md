# Fire-fighting-and-Obstacleavoidance-robot
An Arduino-based autonomous robot designed to detect, track, and extinguish fires while avoiding obstacles. The robot uses three flame sensors (left, center, right) to locate fire sources and an H-bridge motor driver to navigate with precision. When a fire is detected, a relay-controlled water pump is activated to extinguish it.
